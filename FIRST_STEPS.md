# 🎯 Your First Steps - Let's Build Your Homepage!

Now that your portfolio foundation is set up, let's take the first step together. We'll customize your homepage with a simple example that you can build upon.

## Step 1: Start the Development Server

Open your terminal and run:
```bash
cd /Users/wangxiansen/Desktop/Portfolio
npm run dev
```

Visit http://localhost:3000 - you should see the default Next.js page.

## Step 2: Understanding What Happens Next

When you're ready to continue, you can:

### Option A: Build the Homepage (Recommended First Step)
Ask me to help you:
- "Let's customize the homepage with a hero section"
- "Add a navigation bar"
- "Create a 3D background for the homepage"

### Option B: Create Other Pages
- "Help me create the Projects page"
- "Build the Blog page structure"
- "Set up the Connect page"

### Option C: Learn More About the Stack
- "Explain how file-based routing works"
- "Show me more 3D examples"
- "How do I add more animations?"

## Step 3: What Each File Does (Quick Reference)

**Files you'll edit often:**
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Your homepage content
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Site-wide layout (navigation, footer)
- `src/components/*` - Reusable UI pieces
- `public/images/*` - Your images

**Configuration files (edit once):**
- `src/lib/seo/config.ts` - SEO settings
- `tailwind.config.ts` - Design system colors/fonts

**Files you rarely touch:**
- `package.json` - Dependencies list
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript settings
- `next.config.ts` - Next.js settings

## 🎨 Quick Win: Let's Make a Simple Change

Try this yourself:

1. Open `src/app/page.tsx`
2. Find the heading text
3. Change it to your name
4. Save the file
5. Watch it update in the browser automatically!

This is called **Hot Module Replacement** - changes appear instantly without refreshing.

## 💡 What Makes This Setup Special

**Performance Optimized:**
- Next.js automatically optimizes images
- Only loads 3D when needed
- Server-side rendering for faster initial loads

**Developer Friendly:**
- TypeScript catches errors before they happen
- Tailwind makes styling fast
- Component-based architecture (build once, use everywhere)

**Production Ready:**
- SEO configured
- Mobile responsive (Tailwind handles this)
- Accessible by default

## 🤝 Working Together

Remember our learning style:
1. **Small chunks** - I'll write code in small, digestible pieces
2. **Explanations** - Every line will be explained
3. **Comments** - Code will have clear comments
4. **Teaching** - You'll understand WHY, not just WHAT

## Ready to Continue?

Just tell me what you'd like to build next! Some suggestions:

**Beginner-Friendly:**
- "Create a simple homepage with my name and bio"
- "Add a navigation menu"
- "Make a projects list page"

**More Advanced:**
- "Add a 3D scene to the homepage"
- "Create animated page transitions"
- "Build a contact form with validation"

**Learning:**
- "Explain how the 3D components work"
- "Show me how to use TypeScript types"
- "How do I deploy this?"
