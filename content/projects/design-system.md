# Design System for SaaS Platform

## Challenge

Our enterprise SaaS platform had grown to 50+ applications with inconsistent UI components, making it difficult for users to navigate and for developers to build new features efficiently.

## Solution

Created a comprehensive design system including:
- 80+ reusable components
- Clear documentation and usage guidelines
- Accessibility-first approach (WCAG 2.1 AA compliant)
- Dark mode support
- Responsive layouts

## Impact

- 60% reduction in design-to-development time
- 95% improvement in UI consistency scores
- 40% decrease in accessibility issues
- Adopted across all 50+ applications
